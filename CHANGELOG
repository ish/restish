0.7.2 (2009-02-17)
------------------

* Fix @child matching so it passes unquoted, decoded URL segments to the
  decorated method.


0.7.1 (2009-02-12)
------------------

* Fix to work with WebOb 0.9.6.


0.7 (2009-01-22)
----------------

* Python 2.4 compatability (thanks to Chuck Thier for the patch).
* Fix templating.Renderer to call the intance's method rather a module-scope
  function.
* Extend a renderer's signature to include the output encoding; only
  Renderer.page() sets the encoding by default. This change makes it easier to
  build a page form fragments without causing unicode decode errors.
* Changed paster template to be explicit about path to public resources. (Makes
  it work correctly with Spawning.)
* Use WebError for the paster template's error handing. It's prettier.


0.6 (2009-01-13)
----------------

* Changing the path (child, parent, sibling, etc) of a URL now removes the
  query string and fragment.
* Add a set of server error response factories/exceptions to restish.http,
  similar to those that already existed for client errors.

0.5.2 (2009-01-08)
------------------

* setup.py now specifies zip_safe=False to make it work correctly with the 
  "paster create" command.
